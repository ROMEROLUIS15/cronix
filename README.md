## Features

### Authentication and Security

- **Login with email/password** and **OAuth with Google**
- **Passkeys / biometrics** — WebAuthn with `@simplewebauthn` v13. Fingerprint and Face ID on mobile and desktop without password
- **Identity linking** — if a user registers with email and later joins with Google (or vice-versa), accounts merge automatically. Duplicate accounts are never created thanks to:
  1. **Supabase:** `enable_manual_linking = true` merges auth users with same email
  2. **Application:** `register/actions.ts` verifies existing email with admin client before creating user
  3. **Database:** `UNIQUE(email)` constraint in `users` table
- **Smart callback** — `ensureUserProfile()` looks up by auth ID → by email → creates new, guaranteeing identity fusion
- **Email confirmation** enabled — users verify email before accessing
- **Session timeout** — 30 min inactivity + 12h absolute limit, enforced in middleware
- **Route protection** in Next.js middleware with fast-path: if no `sb-` cookies are present, the round-trip to Supabase Auth is skipped
- **Cached status check** — user status (`active`/`rejected`) is cached in a cookie for 5 minutes, eliminating DB queries on every dashboard navigation
- Blocked users (`status: rejected`) are automatically logged out
- **RLS on passkey_challenges** — protected table, only the user sees their own challenges

### Appointment Management

- Create, edit, and cancel appointments with service, client, and assigned employee selection
- **Interactive monthly calendar** with daily appointment view
- **Double booking validation** configurable by business: `allowed` / `warn` / `blocked`
- **Resolution of expired appointments** — "Yes, attended" / "No-show" buttons with responsive wrapping
- **Automated WhatsApp reminders** — when creating or editing an appointment, a reminder is scheduled with Meta's `appointment_reminder` template (4 variables: client name, business name, date, time)
- Statuses: `pending`, `confirmed`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `no_show`

### WhatsApp Reminders

- `appointment_reminders` table with statuses `pending → sent / failed / cancelled`
- **Supabase pg_cron** executes `cron-reminders` Edge Function daily at 00:00 UTC
- Edge Function `cron-reminders` processes the queue and calls `whatsapp-service` EF
- Integration with Meta's **WhatsApp Cloud API v19.0**
- **Permanent token** (Meta Business Manager System User Token, does not expire)
- Template with 4 variables: `{{1}}` client, `{{2}}` business, `{{3}}` date, `{{4}}` time
- Implicit retries: if it fails, the record remains in `failed` with the error message
- After sending WhatsApp, it triggers a Web Push to the business owner as confirmation

### Client Management

- Full CRUD with contact details, notes, tags, and avatar photo
- Appointment history per client
- Debt management (`DebtActionDialog` dialog)

### Team / Employees

- Owners (`owner`) can create, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete employees
- Protected with `assertOwner()` in server actions — only the owner can manage the team
- Operations use `createAdminClient()` (service role) to bypass RLS, with explicit authorization validation at the server layer
- Anti-deletion protection: an employee with assigned appointments cannot be deleted

### Finances

- Recording of transactions and income
- Recording of expenses by categories (`supplies`, `rent`, `utilities`, `payroll`, `marketing`, `equipment`, `other`)
- Multiple payment methods: cash, card, transfer, QR, others
